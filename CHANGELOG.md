# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
from version 5.0.0 on.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* `arara` now features an API and a library to ease developing an own TeX
  compilation workflow.

### Changed

* `arara` is now split into an API, a core implementation (library) and the
  implementation of the executable (cli). Projects relying on code in the
  `arara` JAR distributions have to be updated.
  (breaking change)
* Languages have to be passed as IETF BCP 47 codes. The old system has been
  removed. Hence, please use `en-QN` instead of `qn` etc.
* The log file may now be specified as path anywhere on the file system.
  Warning: This behavior may be altered for a future safe mode.
  (see https://github.com/cereda/arara/issues/133).

### Removed

* Removed the `<arara>` shorthand notation which has been deprecated in version
  5.0.0.
  (see #26; breaking change)
* Removed the preambles feature. It will be replaced by a configuration option
  through the Kotlin DSL.

## [5.1.3] - 2020-04-23

### Added

* New rule for the authorindex package/perl script).
  (see [this StackExchange post](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/539935/where-can-i-find-a-copy-of-the-arara-rule-file-authorindex-yaml-for-authorind?))

### Fixed

* In version 5.1.2, we introduced a different loading order for configuration
  files. This has fixed the loading of preambles but broke the loading of other
  settings. We accounted for that in v5.1.3.
  (see #44)

## [5.1.2] - 2020-04-19

### Added

* New rules for PythonTeX and PerlTeX have been added on user request.
  (see #42)

### Fixed

* The configuration file has been loaded too late. That's why preambles did
  not work any longer.
  (see #43)

## [5.1.1] - 2020-04-14

### Fixed

* TeX-related rules were updated to use `reference.getName()` instead of
  `reference` due to some issues when using absolute paths.

## [5.1.0] - 2020-04-03

### Added

* New rules for ConTeXt, fig2dev, qpdf, convert, texcount and detex.
  (see #10)

### Fixed

* `unsafelyExecuteSystemCommand` failed to execute in the current directory.

## [5.0.2] - 2020-03-07

### Fixed

* Running `arara` failed on Windows due to wrong path encodings.
  (see #35)

## [5.0.1] - 2020-03-05

### Changed

* The CI builds now produce a CTAN-ready zip file instead of running the
  documentation build separately

### Fixed

* Multiple rules did use a `file` reference where it should have used
  `reference` instead.
* Documentation still mentioned `file` although it should have been marked
  removed since version 5.0.0.

## [5.0.0] - 2020-03-03

### Added

* Working directory support has been added. Users may now specify their working
  directory by passing a command-line option.
  (see #13)
* `arara` features support for processing multiple files. Prerequisite: They
  are located within the same working directory.
* The most important update release notes are shown when calling arara with the
  version flag.
  (see #25)
* Multiple rules have been added. All of them are untested and we are open for
  feedback and enhancements: `asymptote`, `luahbtex`, `metapost`, `pbibtex`,
  `platex`, `ptex`, `upbibtex`, `uplatex`, `uptex`, `xindex`.
  (see #10)

### Changed

* The build process is now based on Gradle instead of Maven. This includes new
  tasks providing all necessary tooling to create CTAN uploads.
  (see #8)
* The application has been rewritten in Kotlin and the code has been streamlined
  to its use cases. That includes we now run a test suite (which is far from
  exhaustive).
* The application is now hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/arara).
  From now on, support will be provided there.
* The file lookup now performs an additional lookup step. File names ending on a
  period will ignore the period (use case: command-line completion by various
  shells) in the second lookup. So `arara file.` will resolve `file..tex`
  etc. first and then (if no luck yet) try to resolve `file.tex`.
* `arara` does not use a XML database anymore. File changes are recorded in a
  YAML database instead.
* The `biber` rule is now aware of the biber option `tool`.
  (see https://github.com/cereda/arara/issues/136)

### Deprecated

* The `<arara>` shorthand notation will be removed in the next major release.
  (see #26)
* The file names of distributed rules being public should not be relied upon
  anymore because there are plans to rename them.
  (see #32)

### Removed

* Removed triggers and introduced session namespaces as a replacement
  (see #15, #2, #17; breaking change)
* Removed velocity and with it all support for templating languages for now.
  It is not planned to reintroduce such a dependency to the core. But rules
  supporting templating tools are welcome.
  (see #8; breaking change)
* Removed string-based commands. Guessing the intention of a string is a strong
  kind of opinionating syntax which will not be followed further.
  (see #2; breaking change)
* Removed support for `user.dir`; no lookup will be performed on this variable.
  (see #16; breaking change)
* Removed auxiliary tools such as the separate CTAN packager, language checker
  and rule converter. They have been merged into the test suite or build process
  or lost relevance.
* Removed `file` reference. The replacement `reference` is correctly typed
  and available since version 4.0.

### Fixed

* `unsafelyExecuteSystemCommand` now respects `getCommandWithWorkingDirectory`
  (previously, working directories have been ignored; see #21).

## [4.0.0] - 2018-07-10

### Added

* Support for multiline directives was added.
* The exit status checking can be adjusted.
* Partial directive extraction mode has been added (only scan until the first
  non-comment line is encountered).
* The user may define preambles to share common preambles between files that
  require the same compilation setup.
* Support for running code from `class` and `jar` files has been added.
* `Command`s and `Trigger`s have been introduced as abstraction layers.

### Changed

* arara follows a REPL workflow (rule evaluation on demand as opposed to prior
  to execution).
* The rule format has been reworked, e.g. `command` has become `commands`
  (breaking change).
* The lookup strategy for configuration files has been altered and extended.

### Deprecated

* String-based commands require guesswork and opinionated syntax. Hence, they
  will be removed in version 5.0.

### Removed

* Cross-platform installers have been retired. `arara` is available in all major
  TeX distributions.

<!-- END CHANGELOG -->

## [3.0] - 2013-02-07

### Added

* Localized messages in English, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Turkish and Russian.
* Friendly and very detailed messages instead of generic ones.
* An optional configuration file is now available in order to customize and enhance the application behaviour.
* Now rules are unified in a plain format. No more compiled rules.
* Rules can allow an arbitrary number of commands instead of just one.
* Built-in functions in the rule context to ease the writing process.

### Fixed

* Improved error analysis for rules and directives.
* Improved rule syntax, new keys added.
* Improved expansion mechanism.

## [2.0] - 2012-07-24

### Added

* Added the `--timeout n` flag to allow setting a timeout for every task. If
     the timeout is reached before the task ends, `arara` will kill it and
     interrupt the processing. The `n` value is expressed in milliseconds.
* There's no need of noninteractive commands anymore. `arara` can now handle
     user input through the `--verbose` tag. If the flag is not set and the
     command requires user interaction, the task execution is interrupted.
* Added the `@{SystemUtils}` orb tag to provide specific operating system
     checks. The orb tag maps the `SystemUtils` class from the amazing
     [Apache Commons Lang](http://commons.apache.org/lang/) library and
     all of its methods and properties.

### Fixed

* Fixed the `--verbose` flag to behave as a realtime output.
* Fixed the execution of some script-based system commands to ensure
     cross-platform compatibility.

## [1.0.1] - 2012-04-24

### Added

* Added support for `.tex`, `.dtx` and `.ltx` files. When no extension is
     provided, `arara` will automatically look for these extensions in this
     specific order.
* Added the `--verbose` flag to allow printing the complete log in the
     terminal. A short `-v` tag is also available. Both `stdout` and `stderr`
     are printed.
* Fixed exit status when an exception is thrown. Now `arara` also returns a
     non-zero exit status when something wrong happened. Note that this
     behaviour happens only when `arara` is processing a file.

## [1.0] - 2012-04-24

* Initial release
