ERROR_BASENAME_NOT_A_FILE=The ''basename'' method requires a file, not a directory. It looks like ''{0}'' does not appear to be a file at all. If you need to perform tasks on a directory, you could use a couple of methods from the Java API.
ERROR_CALCULATEHASH_IO_EXCEPTION=For whatever reason, I could not calculate the hash. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the hashing operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_CHECKBOOLEAN_NOT_VALID_BOOLEAN=It looks like ''{0}'' is not a valid boolean value. This should be an easy fix. Make sure to use a valid string that represents boolean values (yes and no, true and false, 1 and 0, and on and off).
ERROR_CHECKOS_INVALID_OPERATING_SYSTEM=I could not check your operating system. The provided value ''{0}'' does not look like a valid operating system entry in my list (I might also be wrong, of course). Please correct the value and try again.
ERROR_CHECKREGEX_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not read the contents of the file ''{0}'', I got an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_CONFIGURATION_GENERIC_ERROR=I could not parse the configuration file, something bad happened. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying data serialization format. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_CONFIGURATION_LOOPS_INVALID_RANGE=The value defined in the 'loops' key in the configuration file in order to denote the maximum number of loops has an invalid range. Please make sure to use a positive long value.
ERROR_DISCOVERFILE_FILE_NOT_FOUND=I could not find the provided file ''{0}'' {1}. Please make sure the file exists and it has a valid extension.
ERROR_EVALUATE_COMPILATION_FAILED=For whatever reason, I could not compile the expression in the provided conditional. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_EVALUATE_NOT_BOOLEAN_VALUE=The conditional evaluation was expecting a boolean value as result. This should be an easy fix. Just make sure the conditional evaluation resolves to a boolean value in the end.
ERROR_EXTRACTOR_IO_ERROR=There was an IO error while I was trying to extract the directives. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the extraction operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_FILETYPE_NOT_A_FILE=The ''filetype'' method requires a file, not a directory. It looks like ''{0}'' does not appear to be a file at all. If you need to perform tasks on a directory, you could use a couple of methods from the Java API.
ERROR_FILETYPE_UNKNOWN_EXTENSION=I cannot recognize ''{0}'' as a default extension. If you want to define a new file type, make sure to provide the extension and pattern. These are the default extensions: {1}
ERROR_GETAPPLICATIONPATH_ENCODING_EXCEPTION=There was an encoding problem while trying to obtain the application path. There is nothing much I can do about it.
ERROR_GETCANONICALFILE_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not get the canonical file due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the lookup operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions.
ERROR_GETPARENTCANONICALPATH_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not get the parent canonical path due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the hashing operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_ARGUMENT_IS_REQUIRED=It seems that ''{0}'' is marked as required in the rule, but I could not find it in the directive parameters. Please make sure to add it as parameter for your directive and try again.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_COMMAND_RUNTIME_ERROR=I could not evaluate one of the provided commands. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_DEFAULT_VALUE_RUNTIME_ERROR=I could not evaluate the default value expression of one of the arguments. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_EXIT_RUNTIME_ERROR=I could not evaluate the exit status expression of one of the provided commands. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_FLAG_RUNTIME_EXCEPTION=I could not evaluate the flag expression of one of the arguments. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_RULE_NOT_FOUND=I could not find a rule named ''{0}'' in the provided rule paths. Perhaps a misspelled word? I was looking for a file named ''{0}.yaml'' in the following paths in order of priority: {1}
ERROR_INTERPRETER_UNKNOWN_KEYS=I found these unknown keys in the directive: {0}. This should be an easy fix, just remove them from your map.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_WRONG_EXIT_CLOSURE_RETURN=The 'exit' expression must always return a boolean value (even if there is no computation in the closure body). This should be an easy fix: make sure to correct the type return statement and try again.
ERROR_ISSUBDIRECTORY_NOT_A_DIRECTORY=The ''isSubdirectory'' method requires a directory, not a file. It looks like ''{0}'' does not appear to be a directory at all.
ERROR_LANGUAGE_INVALID_CODE=The provided language code is invalid. Currently, I know how to speak the following languages: {0}
ERROR_LOAD_COULD_NOT_LOAD_XML=I could not load the YAML database named ''{0}''. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file. By the way, make sure the YAML file is well-formed.
ERROR_PARSER_INVALID_PREAMBLE=I am sorry, but the preamble ''{0}'' could not be found. Please make sure this key exists in the configuration file.
ERROR_PARSERULE_GENERIC_ERROR=I could not parse the rule, something bad happened. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying data serialization format. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_REPLICATELIST_MISSING_FORMAT_ARGUMENTS_EXCEPTION=I could not replicate the list due to a missing format argument. My guess is that there are less (or more) parameters than expected. Make sure to correct the number of parameters and try again.
ERROR_RULE_IDENTIFIER_AND_PATH=I have spotted an error in rule ''{0}'' located at ''{1}''.
ERROR_RUN_GENERIC_EXCEPTION=I could not run the provided system command, something bad happened. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying expression language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_RUN_INTERRUPTED_EXCEPTION=The provided system command execution was suddenly interrupted. Maybe there was an external interruption that forced the command to end abruptly.
ERROR_RUN_INVALID_EXIT_VALUE_EXCEPTION=The provided system command execution has returned an invalid exit value.
ERROR_RUN_IO_EXCEPTION=The system command execution has failed due to an IO error. Are you sure the provided system command exists in your path? It might be a good idea to check the path and see if the command is available.
ERROR_RUN_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTION=The system command execution reached the provided timeout value and was aborted. If the time was way too short, make sure to provide a longer value.
ERROR_RUN_TIMEOUT_INVALID_RANGE=The timeout value is probably missing (although timeout is enabled). This should be an easy fix. Please make sure to provide a positive long value.
ERROR_SAVE_COULD_NOT_SAVE_XML=I could not save the YAML database named ''{0}''. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps I do not have the proper permissions to write the YAML file to disk.
ERROR_SESSION_OBTAIN_UNKNOWN_KEY=The ''get'' method has found an unknown key ''{0}'' in the session scope. I could not get something I do not have in the first place. Please enter a valid key and try again.
ERROR_SESSION_REMOVE_UNKNOWN_KEY=The ''remove'' method has found an unknown key ''{0}'' in the session scope. I could not remove something I do not have in the first place. Please enter a valid key and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_EMPTY_FILES_LIST=I read a directive {0} and found out that the provided ''files'' list is empty. This is an easy fix: make sure the list has at least one element and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_FILES_IS_NOT_A_LIST=I read a directive {0} and found out that ''files'' requires a list. Please make sure to correct the type to a proper list and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_INVALID_DIRECTIVE_FORMAT=I spotted an invalid directive {0} in the provided file. Make sure to fix the directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_NO_DIRECTIVES_FOUND=It looks like no directives were found in the provided file. Make sure to include at least one directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_ORPHAN_LINEBREAK=Apparently there is an orphan directive line break in line {0}. I cannot proceed. Please correct the directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_REFERENCE_IS_RESERVED=I read a directive {0} and found out that the key ''reference'' was used. This key is reserved, so you cannot use it. But do not worry, this should be an easy fix. Just replace it by another name.
ERROR_VALIDATE_YAML_EXCEPTION=There was a problem with the provided YAML map in a directive {0}. This part is quite tricky, since it involves aspects of the underlying data serialization format.
ERROR_VALIDATEBODY_ARGUMENT_ID_IS_RESERVED=The argument identifier ''{0}'' is reserved, so you cannot use it. This should be an easy fix. Just replace it by another name.
ERROR_VALIDATEBODY_DUPLICATE_ARGUMENT_IDENTIFIERS=Apparently you have duplicate argument identifiers in your rule. Make sure to fix this issue and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATEBODY_MISSING_KEYS=When defining a rule argument scope, at least 'flag' or 'default' must be used. Please, make sure to use at least one of them.
ERROR_VALIDATEBODY_NULL_ARGUMENT_ID=I found out that one of the arguments has no identifier. Please, make sure to add a valid identifier to the argument and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATEBODY_NULL_COMMAND=I found a null command in the provided rule. This should be an easy fix. Make sure to add a valid command to the rule.
ERROR_VALIDATEHEADER_NULL_ID=The provided rule has no identifier. This is a crucial information, please make sure to fix this issue and try again. Make sure the identifier has the same name of the rule file (without the extension, of course).
ERROR_VALIDATEHEADER_NULL_NAME=The provided rule has no name. This should be an easy fix. Make sure to add a valid name and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATEHEADER_WRONG_IDENTIFIER=The rule has a wrong identifier. I was expecting ''{0}'', but found ''{1}''. This should be an easy fix: just replace the wrong identifier by the correct one.
